An easy to use and extendable IRC bouncer

*Still a work in progress*
Currently it can connect to multiple irc servers and channels, as well as accept client connections.
The client and servers do not talk to eachother yet though, which makes it more like the world's most mute bot than a bouncer.

##Roadmap
Features to be built out, in order:
* Pass messages between irc servers and client (Makes it a functioning bouncer!)
* Support runtime option/config setting from IRC client
* Support runtime option/config setting from WebUI
