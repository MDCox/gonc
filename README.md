An easy to use and extendable IRC bouncer

*Still a work in progress*
Currently it can connect to multiple irc servers and channels.
BUT it cannot accept client connections yet, which makes it less a bouncer right now and more like a very present but mute bot.  The server for the client to connect to is the next step.

##Roadmap
Features to be built out, in order:
* Support client connections (technically then a functional bouncer)
* Support concurrent client connections
* Support runtime option/config setting from IRC client
* Support runtime option/config setting from WebUI
